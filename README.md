I create a class called "Node".

After i wrote this function;

# find();
Search for the key value in the list

# addHead();
Adds value to the first order of the list

# addEnd();
Adds value to the last order of the list

# addBetween();
Adds value to the where if we wanted to place? in the list 

**Example** 
`addBetween(45,3);` //The node value of 45, add 3. place
 
# deleteHead();
This method deletes value to the first order of the list

# deleteEnd();
This method deletes value to the last order of the list

# deleteOrder();
Deletes the value in the specified location

# deleteNode();
This method is to delete nodes

# printList(); 
This method will print the list from start to finish
